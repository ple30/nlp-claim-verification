# Group 81 COMP90042 Assignment 3 Claim verification

We present a claim verification system that retrieves the most relevant evidence sentences for a given claim and determines, based on those evidences, whether the claim can be supported. 

## Instructions to run code
1. The main notebook that implemented the models described in the report is Group81_ COMP90042_Project_2025.ipynb
2. The second notebook lstm_model.ipynb shows an experimental LSTM model that we tried but does not give good result
3. The ipynb files include codes for installing dependencies, so just run all codes from top to bottom
4. Note: please get evidence.json file from https://github.com/drcarenhan/COMP90042_2025.git and put it in your Google Drive. When accessing this in Colab, please replace with the path to your evidence.json file, this is specified in the notebook as well
5. The final result evaluated by eval.py may vary, so in Group81_ COMP90042_Project_2025.ipynb we included a screenshot of the result we describe in the report
